# PRD ‚Äî Calendly Lite ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Problem
Back-and-forth scheduling wastes time. We need a tiny, fast booking flow: share a link ‚Üí pick a time ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí add to calendar. No heavy backend.

## Users
- Host (single owner for MVP)
- Guest (anyone with the public link)

## In-Scope (MVP) ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Two event types (public):**
  - `/b/intro-call` ‚Äî **30-min Intro Call**, desc: "Let's connect."
  - `/b/coffee-chat` ‚Äî **15-min Coffee Chat**, desc: "Quick virtual coffee."
- **Booking page (App Router):**
  - Header with title, duration badge, description, **auto-detected timezone**
  - Date picker (next 30 days, past dates disabled)
  - Slot list with **6 fixed daily slots**: 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 14:00, 14:30
  - Confirm dialog with name + email validation (Zod)
  - **Loading states** and **empty states** for better UX
- **Confirmation page:**
  - Show details (title, start, end, duration) with timezone
  - **Real .ics download** via `/api/ics` with proper CRLF formatting
  - Copy details to clipboard (Sonner toast notifications)
  - **Error handling** for missing booking parameters
- **Full A11y compliance**: WCAG guidelines, keyboard navigation, 44px touch targets
- **Mobile-first responsive UI** using shadcn/ui components

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- Auth, DB persistence, email notifications
- Buffers/blackouts, real calendar integrations  
- Multi-tenant admin
- Dynamic slot availability (uses fixed mock slots)

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.3 (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form + @hookform/resolvers + Zod validation
- **Calendar**: react-day-picker for date selection
- **Notifications**: Sonner for toast messages
- **Additional Dependencies Added**:
  - `@radix-ui/*` components (dialog, popover, dropdown-menu, slot)
  - `date-fns` for date manipulation
  - `react-day-picker` for calendar component
  - `axios` for potential future API calls
  - `class-variance-authority` for component variants

## Key Features Implemented
- **Auto-timezone detection**: Uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
- **Proper ICS generation**: RFC-compliant calendar files with unique UIDs
- **Form validation**: Real-time inline error messages
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first with desktop 2-column layout
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful handling of missing data and invalid routes
- **Loading states**: Skeleton placeholders during data loading
- **Toast notifications**: User feedback for copy actions and errors

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ MET
- ‚úÖ Guest can book from `/b/intro-call` or `/b/coffee-chat`
- ‚úÖ Form validation with name + email requirements
- ‚úÖ Download working `.ics` files that open in Google/Apple/Outlook Calendar
- ‚úÖ Copy booking details to clipboard with toast confirmation

- ‚úÖ **Bonus**: Auto-detected timezone display for better UX

## Deployment Ready
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` ‚Üí optimized for deployment
- **No Environment Variables Required**: Fully self-contained MVP
- **No Database Dependencies**: Stateless booking flow

# PRD ‚Äî Calendly Lite (Phase 2: Homepage + Branding)

## Problem
Back-and-forth scheduling wastes time. Calendly set the blueprint for solving this, but we want to add a playful, vibrant spin that feels personal and true to the digitalflower vibe.

## Users
- Host (single owner for MVP)
- Guest (anyone with the public link)

## In-Scope (Phase 2)
- **Homepage at `/`**:
  - Inspired by Calendly‚Äôs landing experience
  - Host identity section: round avatar (playful illustration), name, tagline
  - CTA: *‚ÄúPick a vibe, not just a time ‚ú®‚Äù*
  - Event cards:
    - **Let‚Äôs Bloom (30 min)** ‚Äî *‚ÄúA half hour to plant ideas, swap stories, and see what grows üå±.‚Äù*
    - **Coffee Chat (15 min)** ‚Äî *‚ÄúShort, sweet, and caffeinated ‚òï ‚Äî a quick burst of connection.‚Äù*
  - Each card uses a unique playful shape (e.g., 8-point star, blob) and links to `/b/[slug]`
  - Hover effect: fade 50% brightness + glow in complementary palette color

- **Branding**:
  - Bright + vibrant palette applied consistently across app:
    - Primary Purple (deep): `#4E0250`
    - Accent Purple (bright): `#801A86`
    - Muted Purple/Gray: `#645986`
    - Accent Green (fresh): `#8FE388`
    - Deep Green (contrast): `#58BC82`
  - Buttons, badges, and highlights updated to reflect palette
  - Tone: playful, approachable, quirky (digitalflower style)

- **Footer**:
  - Text: *‚ÄúInspired by Calendly, built by me üíú digitalflower‚Äù*
  - Social icons: GitHub, LinkedIn, Bluesky
  - Hover states in palette colors; accessible labels

## Out of Scope (Phase 2)
- Multi-tenant hosting (still single owner)
- Real calendar integrations beyond .ics
- Custom theme picker (palette fixed in Tailwind config)

## Technical Implementation Details
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (extended with custom palette)
- **Shapes**: Tailwind utilities + CSS clip-path (for star/blob)
- **Hover Effects**: Tailwind opacity + drop-shadow/glow
- **Socials**: Radix icons or lucide-react

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Homepage at `/` loads with avatar, name, tagline, and CTA
- ‚úÖ Event cards display in custom shapes, animate on hover
- ‚úÖ Clicking event card routes to correct booking flow
- ‚úÖ Footer visible with correct text + working social links
